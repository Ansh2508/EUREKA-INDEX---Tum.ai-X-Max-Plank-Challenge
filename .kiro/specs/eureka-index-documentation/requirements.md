# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive reference documentation for the EUREKA INDEX project - an AI-powered technology transfer analysis platform developed for the CDTM x TUM.AI Hackathon. The documentation will serve as a complete reference for future development, onboarding new developers, and understanding the project's context, architecture, and implementation details.

The EUREKA INDEX project addresses the "European Innovation Paradox" by building an AI-powered RAG/LLM system to help researchers and Technology Transfer offices identify patenting opportunities and key players early in the research lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the EUREKA INDEX project, I want comprehensive hackathon context documentation, so that I can understand the project's origin, objectives, and target users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the hackathon context documentation THEN I SHALL understand the event details including organizers, dates, and prize structure
2. WHEN I review the challenge description THEN I SHALL understand the European Innovation Paradox and the project's role in addressing it
3. WHEN I examine the target users section THEN I SHALL understand the needs of research groups and Technology Transfer offices
4. WHEN I read the objective section THEN I SHALL understand the AI-powered RAG/LLM system requirements and expected outcomes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating external APIs, I want complete API usage documentation, so that I can understand how to authenticate, make requests, and handle responses for all external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to integrate Logic Mill API THEN I SHALL find complete documentation including authentication, endpoints, request/response formats, and PatSPECTER model usage
2. WHEN I work with Espacenet API THEN I SHALL find documented integration patterns and usage examples
3. WHEN I use OpenAlex API THEN I SHALL find complete implementation details and data retrieval patterns
4. WHEN I integrate other APIs (Anthropic, Groq) THEN I SHALL find authentication and usage documentation
5. WHEN I review API documentation THEN I SHALL find working code examples for each API integration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want detailed documentation of all backend features and implementations, so that I can understand, maintain, and extend the existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review core functionality documentation THEN I SHALL understand semantic patent alerts, competitor discovery, licensing opportunities, and novelty assessment features
2. WHEN I examine technical implementation details THEN I SHALL understand all AI agents, API routes, services, and data processing pipelines
3. WHEN I need to work with specific components THEN I SHALL find documentation for semantic_alerts.py, competitor_discovery.py, licensing_opportunities.py, and enhanced_novelty.py
4. WHEN I review input/output specifications THEN I SHALL understand expected data formats, processing steps, and output structures
5. WHEN I examine the analysis logic THEN I SHALL understand the core algorithms and decision-making processes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a comprehensive implementation guide for a modern dashboard interface, so that I can create a professional React-based patent intelligence dashboard similar to the provided HTML template.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review the current implementation THEN I SHALL understand the React + Vite structure, existing pages, components, and styling approach
2. WHEN I implement the modern dashboard THEN I SHALL find detailed specifications for sidebar navigation, multi-page layout, stats grids, and interactive visualizations
3. WHEN I create dashboard components THEN I SHALL find specifications for patent alerts, competitor analysis, licensing opportunities, novelty assessment, and comprehensive analysis features
4. WHEN I implement interactive features THEN I SHALL find specifications for real-time charts, network visualizations, patent landscape maps, and data export functionality
5. WHEN I work on responsive design THEN I SHALL understand the desktop and tablet requirements with collapsible sidebar and mobile-first approach
6. WHEN I integrate with backend APIs THEN I SHALL find specifications for connecting React components to FastAPI endpoints for real-time data updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want well-organized reference documentation, so that I can easily find specific information and keep the documentation updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to find specific documentation THEN I SHALL find it organized in logical sections within the docs/ folder
2. WHEN I review the documentation structure THEN I SHALL find separate files for hackathon context, API reference, backend features, frontend guide, data sources, deployment, and user guide
3. WHEN I read any documentation file THEN I SHALL find clear, professional formatting suitable for reference and onboarding
4. WHEN I need to update documentation THEN I SHALL find a maintainable structure that supports incremental updates
5. WHEN I onboard new team members THEN I SHALL find documentation that provides complete context and implementation details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a stakeholder or team member, I want additional context documentation, so that I can understand the broader ecosystem and resources related to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review the Max Planck Society context THEN I SHALL understand the organization's scale, focus areas, and relevance to the project
2. WHEN I need contact information THEN I SHALL find relevant websites, LinkedIn profiles, GitHub repositories, and Hugging Face resources
3. WHEN I examine deployment information THEN I SHALL understand how to deploy the complete system in production
4. WHEN I need user guidance THEN I SHALL find end-user documentation for researchers and TT office professionals
5. WHEN I review data sources THEN I SHALL understand all external data integrations and their purposes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working with the Logic Mill API, I want detailed implementation examples, so that I can correctly implement document similarity searches and handle API responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I implement own document similarity search THEN I SHALL find complete GraphQL query examples with proper authentication
2. WHEN I work with document similarity search by ID THEN I SHALL find working code examples for both patents and publications databases
3. WHEN I handle API responses THEN I SHALL understand the response structure including scores, indices, and document metadata
4. WHEN I implement error handling THEN I SHALL find documented error scenarios and proper handling patterns
5. WHEN I work with the PatSPECTER model THEN I SHALL understand embedding generation and similarity calculation processes
