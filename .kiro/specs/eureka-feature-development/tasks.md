# Implementation Plan

## Feature-by-Feature Development Approach

Each feature will be implemented as a complete vertical slice with backend, frontend, testing, and integration. Features must be fully working before moving to the next one.

## Existing Codebase Integration Strategy

The project has many existing files that need to be properly handled:

### ‚úÖ Files to Keep and Refactor
- `backend/src/analysis.py` - Core analysis logic (refactor into ResearchAnalysisService)
- `backend/src/search_logic_mill.py` - Logic Mill integration (fix and enhance)
- `backend/src/services/logic_mill.py` - API service (fix authentication)
- `backend/src/agents/semantic_alerts.py` - Patent alerts (fix ML dependencies)
- `backend/src/agents/competitor_discovery.py` - Competitor analysis (fix imports)
- `backend/src/agents/licensing_opportunities.py` - Licensing features (refactor)
- `frontend/src/pages/Analysis.jsx` - Research analysis page (enhance)
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Dashboard page (modernize)
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Main app (enhance navigation)

### üîß Files to Fix Critical Issues
- `requirements-minimal.txt` - Add missing ML dependencies (sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, networkx, pandas, numpy)
- `backend/main.py` - Fix async/sync bug on line 493, register missing routes
- `backend/src/agents/enhanced_novelty.py` - Remove 600+ lines of duplicate code

### ‚ùå Files to Delete or Consolidate
- Duplicate agent files (keep only the working versions)
- Unused route files that aren't properly integrated
- Any broken or incomplete implementations that can't be easily fixed

### üö® Critical Issues to Address First
