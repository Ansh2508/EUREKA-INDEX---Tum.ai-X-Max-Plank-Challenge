# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing the EUREKA INDEX project using a feature-by-feature development approach. Each feature will be fully implemented with backend API, frontend interface, testing, and integration before moving to the next feature. This ensures stability, maintainability, and prevents integration issues.

The EUREKA INDEX project is an AI-powered technology transfer analysis platform that helps researchers and Technology Transfer offices identify patenting opportunities and key players early in the research lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement features incrementally, so that each feature is fully functional and tested before adding complexity with additional features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a feature THEN I SHALL have implemented both backend API endpoints and frontend interface components
2. WHEN I finish a feature THEN I SHALL have written and passed all tests for that feature
3. WHEN I move to the next feature THEN I SHALL ensure the previous feature remains fully functional
4. WHEN I integrate features THEN I SHALL maintain backward compatibility and avoid breaking existing functionality
5. WHEN I deploy a feature THEN I SHALL have a working end-to-end implementation that users can interact with

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a basic research analysis feature, so that I can submit my research abstract and get patent similarity analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit a research title and abstract THEN I SHALL receive a list of similar patents with similarity scores
2. WHEN I view the results THEN I SHALL see patent titles, abstracts, similarity percentages, and publication dates
3. WHEN I interact with the interface THEN I SHALL have a clean, professional form for input and results display
4. WHEN I use the API THEN I SHALL get consistent response formats and proper error handling
5. WHEN I test the feature THEN I SHALL have automated tests covering API endpoints and frontend components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a patent analyst, I want a patent alerts dashboard, so that I can monitor new patents similar to my research interests and receive notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set up patent alerts THEN I SHALL be able to define search criteria and similarity thresholds
2. WHEN new similar patents are found THEN I SHALL receive notifications in the dashboard
3. WHEN I view alerts THEN I SHALL see a list of recent alerts with patent details and similarity scores
4. WHEN I manage alerts THEN I SHALL be able to create, edit, and delete alert configurations
5. WHEN I use the alerts system THEN I SHALL have real-time updates without page refresh

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a technology transfer professional, I want competitor analysis tools, so that I can identify key players and institutions in my technology domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze competitors THEN I SHALL see top inventors, authors, and institutions in my domain
2. WHEN I view competitor data THEN I SHALL see patent counts, publication metrics, and collaboration networks
3. WHEN I explore the network THEN I SHALL have interactive visualizations showing relationships between entities
4. WHEN I export data THEN I SHALL be able to download competitor analysis reports
5. WHEN I use the analysis THEN I SHALL have filtering and sorting capabilities for large datasets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want licensing opportunity identification, so that I can find patents available for licensing in my technology area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for licensing opportunities THEN I SHALL find patents available for licensing with estimated values
2. WHEN I view opportunities THEN I SHALL see patent details, owner information, and contact details
3. WHEN I filter opportunities THEN I SHALL be able to search by technology domain, value range, and geographic region
4. WHEN I track opportunities THEN I SHALL be able to save and monitor licensing deals
5. WHEN I contact patent owners THEN I SHALL have integrated communication tools or contact information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a patent attorney, I want novelty assessment tools, so that I can evaluate the novelty of research before filing patent applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit research for novelty assessment THEN I SHALL receive a comprehensive analysis of prior art
2. WHEN I review the assessment THEN I SHALL see similarity scores, key prior art references, and novelty indicators
3. WHEN I analyze claims THEN I SHALL be able to compare specific claims against existing patents
4. WHEN I generate reports THEN I SHALL have professional novelty assessment reports for clients
5. WHEN I use the tool THEN I SHALL have confidence scores and detailed explanations for assessments

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive testing and monitoring, so that I can ensure system reliability and performance across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy features THEN I SHALL have automated tests covering all API endpoints and frontend components
2. WHEN I monitor the system THEN I SHALL have health checks and performance metrics for each feature
3. WHEN errors occur THEN I SHALL have proper error handling and logging for debugging
4. WHEN I scale the system THEN I SHALL have performance benchmarks and optimization guidelines
5. WHEN I maintain the system THEN I SHALL have clear documentation for each feature's architecture and dependencies
